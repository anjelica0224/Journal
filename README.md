# Journal 

## About  
This will perhaps be my first Android app once its done! I'm working on a simple journal app where users can write and save their thoughts for now, which I shall keep expanding on as I learn, once I'm done with the basic version. 

- Designs which inspired me - [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/23155564-Best-Journal-App-Design-Concept) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/210777011/5-Minute-Journal-Productivity-Mobile-App-Design).  
- A minimal ui with a functional button that opens up a partial bottomsheet for adding a note.

## Whatâ€™s Next  
- Connect the app to a Room database to save entries.  
- Add basic functionality like viewing, editing, and deleting entries.  
- Keep improving the design and learning as I go!
